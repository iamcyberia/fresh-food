This resource pack transforms every food item in the game into custom 3D models from the ground up, giving them some much-needed flair. By default, the GUI models will remain 2D, making it compatible with other resource packs like Animated Textures. But if you'd rather use the 3D GUI version, it's available in the download options!

<p align="center">
On top of that, there are also unique eating animations for every food! Apples are eaten from around, fish have bones underneath, and much more for you to see. (…or rather eat)

<p align="center">
In the newest update there are also new nameable variants for all food types so you can display them in an item frame and make it look like the food is really on your table.

<summary>How do I get the plated variants of the foods?</summary>

I'll explain this by using the apple item as an example. Put the apple item in an anvil and change the name to one of these options:

"Plate of Apple"

"Plated Apple"

"Apple on Plate"

"Apple on a Plate"

"Apple Plate"

"Apple Plated"

This works with every food type in the game, as long as you (obviously) change the name “Apple” to whatever item you're trying to get the model for that's on a plate. It's also very important to have the correct capitalizations for the words (so "Apple" not "apple").

Download Not Enough Animations for better looking third person eating animations.

For 1.20.1, 1.21, 1.21.1 you need Pommel and Eating Animations. Without those mods it doesn't work!

Special thanks to [Pato](https://modrinth.com/user/patovskiz) for porting my pack to the older versions. Special thanks to [Braytonks](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/braysworld), who's not only excellent at making stuff, but also in explaining how to!
